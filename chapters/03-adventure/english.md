# Designing an adventure

## Challenges

When players' actions meet resistance, competition or challenge in any form, wether it's enemies to fight, a thief to chase or a fire to escape; PCs must solve a problem or succeed dice rolls, often both.

Depending on the desired difficulty and length of the challenge, the GM can design it in one of the following ways.

| Difficulty              | Complexity  | Appropriate kind of challenge |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Easy                    | Obvious     | Tutorial                      |
| Easy                    | Interesting | Puzzle                        |
| Hard                    | Simple      | Even match                    |
| From hard to impossible | Immense     | Great peril                   |

### Tutorial

Perfect for an introduction to the game system, it also allows players to get acquainted with their characters.

The resolution of this challenge should require each PC to do what it's good at, once or twice.

Typically, for a fight, throw one enemy at each PC that can be dealt with in one blow.

Failures should only lead to minor setbacks or encourage coop.
Players are meant to win fast.

*Examples: a gobelin ambush, cooking lunch for the wedding, performing a theatre play...*

### Puzzle

Great to challenge the creativity of players, this challenge is like an open question for which the answer is not obvious.

> ðŸ’¡ There should never be only one intended solution.

The dice rolls, however, don't have to be difficult.

*Examples : a big rock blocking the path, a moral dilemma, planning an attack on the enemy's camp...*

### Even match

Suitable to make something feel hard won.

One successful dice roll won't be enough to overcome this obstacle.
Heck, succeeding dice rolls itself might prove difficult.
In any case, more dices will be rolled.

> ðŸ’¡ Having to retry or doing the same thing multiple times does not have to feel repetitive.
> The outcome of each dice roll, success or failure, should make the story progress and lead to a different situation.

*Examples: battle against the final boss, convincing a judge in court, building a time machine...*

### Great peril

One cannot fight or outsmart a tsunami.

Should player choose to face this challenge, it would require both a creative solution, because there is no obvious way of dealing with it; and hard won successes in dice rolls, because no easy move will suffice.

The most reasonable thing to do, however, would be to flee.

*Examples: any natural disaster, a dragon, an army...*
