# Designing an adventure

This section is addressed to the GM. It is designed to help you invent a good story and explore different kind of challenges to throw at your party.

## The story

You don't have to make an incredible original story in order to have a memorable moment with your friends.

If your audience is unexperienced, having a basic, simple, predictable scenario will be reassuring.
It will be easier for them to learn how to play this new way of having fun if they don't have to focus too hard on the story. Discovering role-playing games is original enough.

If your audience is already experienced or just inspired, even the most basic premise can escape all control. Which is a good thing!
Their characters can lead the story where they want it to go and they'll have fun doing so.

So don't push yourself to write a complicated, interesting, original story.
If you love writing and are inspired, you can try; but be prepared to be disappointed in the way they'll interact with your precious world, beautiful characters and deep subplots they'll never explore because it's so much more fun to just burn down the tavern...

### Quick and easy scenarios

#### Plain plagiarism

Re-use a well-known story.
It does not have to play out exactly as in the original work, the goal is to make it easier for both you and your audience to picture the frame and the theme.

*Example:*
*A farm boy discovers his legacy the day his aunt and uncle are killed by the bad guys.*
*Some old wizard becomes his mentor, he find new friends that help him escape, rescues a princess and destroys a symbol of power.*

#### Player protagonist

Some players are inspired writers, and their characters have awesome backstories.
Make the story about them!
Allow them to evolve by letting them overcome their flaws, give them what they want or break their dreams.
As long as they're having fun, everything is permitted.

*Example:*
*The personality of one of the PC is defined by the desire to avenge their dead parents.*
*The party's initial quest could be the hunt of their assassin... Who could be revealed to be another player!*

### Writing tips for ambitious writers

#### Top-down

If you find it easier to design stories, plots and scenarios than events, characters and challenges.

In video game slang, you could explain this method as "designing the story first, then deduce the levels based on that".

Try to answer these kinds of questions:
- What kind of story do you want to tell?
- Which tropes do you want to use?
- Which mysteries must the players uncover?

Once you have a good scenario, building the challenges and characters might get easier. You could also rely on improvisation skills and the behavior of your players to come up with new events from the consequence of their choices.

#### Bottom-up

If you find it easier to design events, characters and challenges than stories, plots and scenarios.

In video games slang, you could explain this method as "designing the levels first, then build the story to justify their sequence".

Try to answer these kinds of questions:
- What do you want your players to experience?
- What kind of challenges will they face (see below)?
- What characters do you want them to meet? Which foes to face? What places to explore?

Then, once these building materials are chosen, it might make the scenario easier to build. You could also rely on improvisation skills and the behavior of your players to make the story emerge from the consequence of their choices.

## Challenges

When players' actions meet resistance, competition or challenge in any form, wether it's enemies to fight, a thief to chase or a fire to escape; PCs must solve a problem or succeed dice rolls, often both.

Depending on the desired difficulty and length of the challenge, the GM can design it in one of the following ways.

| Risk of failure | Complexity  | Appropriate kind of challenge |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------- |
| Inexistent      | Obvious     | Tutorial                      |
| Small           | Interesting | Puzzle                        |
| Real            | Simple      | Even match                    |
| Likely          | Immense     | Great peril                   |

### Tutorial

Perfect for an introduction to the game system, it also allows players to get acquainted with their characters.

The resolution of this challenge should require each PC to do what it's good at, once or twice.

Typically, for a fight, throw one enemy at each PC that can be dealt with in one blow.

Failures should only lead to minor setbacks or encourage coop.
Players are meant to win fast.

*Examples: a gobelin ambush, cooking lunch for the wedding, performing a theatre play...*

### Puzzle

Great to challenge the creativity of players, this challenge is like an open question for which the answer is not obvious.

> ðŸ’¡ There should never be only one intended solution.

The dice rolls, however, don't have to be difficult.

*Examples : a big rock blocking the path, a moral dilemma, planning an attack on the enemy's camp...*

### Even match

Suitable to make something feel hard won.

One successful dice roll won't be enough to overcome this obstacle.
Heck, succeeding dice rolls itself might prove difficult.
In any case, more dices will be rolled.

> ðŸ’¡ Having to retry or doing the same thing multiple times does not have to feel repetitive.
> The outcome of each dice roll, success or failure, should make the story progress and lead to a different situation.

*Examples: battle against the final boss, convincing a judge in court, building a time machine...*

### Great peril

One cannot fight or outsmart a tsunami.

Should player choose to face this challenge, it would require both a creative solution, because there is no obvious way of dealing with it; and hard won successes in dice rolls, because no easy move will suffice.

The most reasonable thing to do, however, would be to flee.

*Examples: any natural disaster, a dragon, an army...*
