# Additional gameplay mechanics

These are additional tools for GMs that want to give more options to their players.

## Luck token

Deal with the gods of fate, luck and balance: get miraculously lucky once, but then one of your future enemies gets to be just as lucky once as well.

This deal can be materialized using an item (a coin, a dice, a playing card...) that can be passed around.
This item is called a *luck token*.

The GM can give some to the players at the beginning of the session. When the need comes, players hand them back to the GM in exchange for a favor.
The same way, the GM can spend some to justify anything at the cost of giving one to players.

Alternatively, the GM could wait for a PC to face a desperate situation before offering the player a deal they will not be in position to refuse, introducing the luck token only at this stage.

In order to keep everything fun, luck tokens should be forbidden for offensive usage.
They should be a way to evade an undesirable fate, not to force an unfair situation on anyone.
Think of them as [Deus Ex Machina](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina) triggers.

## Effort and fatigue

There is one action that matters a great deal to you?
Some task you cannot afford to fail?
You want to give it all you've got in one big, glorious move?

This is called an *effort*. It gives a one-time huge bonus to your dice roll.
This effort is costly and will fatigue you though, making any future task harder until you rest.
