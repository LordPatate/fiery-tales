# Core Rules

If you're getting started with role playing, it's probably a good idea to play your first game using these rules only.

As an experienced GM, it is also preferable to use these rules if your players are unexperienced.

You might also want to choose them if you want a faster pace.

## Character creation

Players should try to answer these questions to define their characters:
- In at most 3 words, who / what are you? *Examples: the greatest swordsman, a witty mouse, the king's advisor...*
- What are you good at? *Examples: fighting, sneaking, talking...* 

Depending on the setting, you could add this last one:
- Is there anything special you can do? *Examples: fly, disguise myself, detect lies...*

## Dice rolls and difficulty

Whenever PCs attempt an action for which failure could be interesting (to build up tension, force a more creative approach, conclude the story dramatically...), a dice roll can be requested by the GM.

The GM must first decide on a target difficulty: the minimum / maximum result required to succeed the dice roll.

The table below lists suggested target difficulty depending on a kind of task.
Target difficulties are expressed for 20-faced dices (d20). If you only have 6-sided dices (d6), divide the number by 3.

| Kind of task                        | Suggested target difficulty (d20) |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| within PC's comfort zone            | 6 or higher                       |
| unusual for the PC                  | 9 or higher                       |
| hard for the PC                     | 12 or higher                      |
| the PC needs to overcome a weakness | 15 or higher                      |

To account for special circumstances, bonuses or maluses could be applied.

The outcome of extreme results (typically called "critical successes or failures") should be described with emphasis: either a great success or a great failure, always with unexpected good or bad consequences.

It's generally funnier for the players if the GM announces the target difficulty before the dice is rolled.
