# Core Rules

If you're getting started with role playing, it's probably a good idea to play your first game using these rules only.

As an experienced GM, it is also preferable to use these rules if your players are unexperienced.

You might also want to choose them if you want a faster pace.

## Character creation

Players should try to answer these questions to define their characters:
- In at most 3 words, who / what are you? *Examples: the greatest swordsman, a witty mouse, the king's advisor...*
- What are you good at? *Examples: fighting, sneaking, talking...* 

Depending on the setting, you could add this last one:
- Is there anything special you can do? *Examples: fly, disguise myself, detect lies...*

## Dice rolls and difficulty

Whenever PCs attempt an action for which failure could be interesting (to build up tension, force a more creative approach, conclude the story dramatically...), a dice roll can be requested by the GM.

The GM must first decide on a target difficulty: the minimum / maximum result required to succeed the dice roll.

The table below lists suggested target difficulty depending on a kind of task.
Target difficulties are expressed for 20-faced dices (d20). If you only have 6-sided dices (d6), divide the number by 3.

| Kind of task                        | Suggested target difficulty (d20) |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| within PC's comfort zone            | 6 or higher                       |
| unusual for the PC                  | 9 or higher                       |
| hard for the PC                     | 12 or higher                      |
| the PC needs to overcome a weakness | 15 or higher                      |

To account for special circumstances, bonuses or maluses could be applied.

The outcome of extreme results (typically called "critical successes or failures") should be described with emphasis: either a great success or a great failure, always with unexpected good or bad consequences.

It's generally funnier for the players if the GM announces the target difficulty before the dice is rolled.

## Challenges

When players' actions meet resistance, competition or challenge in any form, wether it's enemies to fight, a thief to chase or a fire to escape; PCs must solve a problem or succeed dice rolls, often both.

Depending on the desired difficulty and length of the challenge, the GM can design it in one of the following ways.

### Easy and obvious

Perfect for an introduction to the game system, it also allows players to get acquainted with their characters.

The resolution of this challenge should require each PC to do what it's good at, once or twice.

Typically, for a fight, throw one enemy at each PC that can be dealt with in one blow.

Failures should only lead to minor setbacks or encourage coop.
Players are meant to win fast.

*Examples: a gobelin ambush, cooking lunch for the wedding, performing a theatre play...*

### Puzzle

Great to challenge the creativity of players, this challenge is like an open question for which the answer is not obvious.

> ðŸ’¡ There should never be only one intended solution.

The dice rolls, however, don't have to be difficult.

*Examples : a big rock blocking the path, a moral dilemma, planning an attack on the enemy's camp...*

### Even match

Suitable to make something feel hard won.

One successful dice roll won't be enough to overcome this obstacle.
Heck, succeeding dice rolls itself might prove difficult.
In any case, more dices will be rolled.

> ðŸ’¡ Having to retry or doing the same thing multiple times does not have to feel repetitive.
> The outcome of each dice roll, success or failure, should make the story progress and lead to a different situation.

*Examples: battle against the final boss, convincing a judge in court, building a time machine...*

### Great peril

One cannot fight or outsmart a tsunami.

Should player choose to face this challenge, it would require both a creative solution, because there is no obvious way of dealing with it; and hard won successes in dice rolls, because no easy move will suffice.

The most reasonable thing to do, however, would be to flee.

*Examples: any natural disaster, a dragon, an army...*
