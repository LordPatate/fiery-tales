# Core Rules

If you're getting started with role playing, it's probably a good idea to play your first game using these rules only.

As an experienced GM, it is also preferable to use these rules if your players are unexperienced.

You might also want to choose them if you want a faster pace.

## Character creation

Players should try to answer these questions to define their characters:
- In at most 3 words, who / what are you? *Examples: the greatest swordsman, a witty mouse, the king's advisor...*
- What are you good at? *Examples: fighting, sneaking, talking...* 

Depending on the setting, you could add this last one:
- Is there anything special you can do? *Examples: fly, disguise myself, detect lies...*

## Dice rolls and difficulty

Whenever PCs attempt an action for which both failure and success could be interesting (to build up tension, force a more creative approach, conclude the story dramatically...), a dice roll can be requested by the GM.

The GM must first decide on a target difficulty: the minimum result required to succeed the dice roll.

The table below lists suggested target difficulty depending on a kind of task.

| Kind of task             | Suggested target difficulty (d20) | Suggested target difficulty (d6) |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| within PC's comfort zone | 8 or higher                       | 3 or higher                      |
| unusual for the PC       | 11 or higher                      | 4 or higher                      |
| hard for the PC          | 14 or higher                      | 5 or higher                      |

The following table describe how to translate d20 faces to d6 faces. 
![Faces 1, 2 and 3 on a d20 correspond to face 1 on a d6. 4, 5, 6 and 7 correspond to 2. 8 to 10 is 3; 14 to 17 is 5 and 18 to 20 is 6.](../../images/dice_faces.svg)

To account for special circumstances, bonuses or maluses could be applied.

> _Example:_
> 
> Alice's character, Adora, is a skilled crime fighter. She needs to jump from one rooftop to another.
> The roofs are 2 meters away from one another, it's an easy task for her.
> The GM asks Alice to roll a d20 with a target difficulty of 8.
> She gets 11, so Adora succeeds.
> 
> Now it's Bob's turn. Unlike Alice, he does not have a d20 so he uses a d6 instead for his rolls.
> Bob's character, Bernard, is not as athletic; this jump is very scary for him.
> To make it, he would have to roll a 5 or higher on his d6.
> Seeing her friend hesitating, Adora encourages him and it makes Bernard feel more confident. The GM decides to translate this effect as a reduction on his roll's target difficulty, making it a 4 or higher.
>
> Bob rolls a 3, so he barely misses. The GM interprets this as Bernard hanging on the edge of the roof and needing rescue from Adora.

The outcome of extreme results (typically called "critical successes or failures") should be described with emphasis: either a great success or a great failure, always with unexpected good or bad consequences.

It's generally funnier for the players if the GM announces the target difficulty before the dice is rolled.
