# Advanced combat

For those who like it complicated. These tools are meant to enrich or ease combat design for the GM.

## Levels

All characters and creatures can be given a *level*.
This level is a number that gives a general idea of the threat that character or creature represents.
It helps answering the question: "who would win in a fight?"

A fight will be balanced if the opposing forces are of equal cumulated levels.
Remember, though, that fights are rarely supposed to be even.

A few rules of thumbs:
- The level can represent the maximum number of hit needed to put that character down.
- The level can represent the maximum amount of damage this character can deal in one blow.
- When attacking a character of lower level, the target difficulty of the attack roll is lower; and vice-versa.

| Character or creature archetype   | Suggested level |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Harmless civilian (e.g. merchant) | 1               |
| Tough civilian (e.g. lumberjack)  | 2               |
| Fighter (e.g. soldier)            | 3               |
| Elite (e.g. knight)               | 4               |
| Boss (e.g. Dragon)                | 10-20           |

PCs are not necessarily fighters, since neither the game nor the story have to revolve around combat.

Thus, depending on how good they are in a fight, PCs can start at any level.
If they get better, they can gain levels; if they get worse (age, injuries, out of practice), they can lose them.

## Weapons stats

### Mastered wielding

Some weapons might require specific training to be used efficiently.
For others, mastering its wielding could unlock its full potential.

Suggested wielding difficulty and mastery perks:

| Weapon       | Untrained wielder                             | Master wielder               |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Dagger       | Easy to use; short range                      | Discrete, precise            |
| Sword        | Hard to use                                   | Fencing techniques           |
| Crossbow     | Easy to use; needs to be recharged every turn | No bonus                     |
| Bow          | Hard to use                                   | Acrobatics and trick shots   |
| Hand gun     | Easy to use                                   | Quick draw and rapid fire    |
| Sniper rifle | Hard to use                                   | Longer range and high damage |
| Light saber  | High risk of self-injury                      | Blocks incoming fire         |

### Damage range

On a successful attack roll, the damage can be derived from the "quality" of the attack roll.
The better the success, the higher the damage.

Each weapon could have a range of damage that can be mapped to the range of favorable roll results.

> _Example:_
> 
> Jiora is wielding a heavy axe that deals 1-5 damages in skilled hands.
> He is used to wielding it, so he usually rolls with an 8 or higher on his d20 for his attacks to hit.
> - If he barely hits (8), he deals 1 damage.
> - A cleaner swing (between 9 and 12) deals 2.
> - On his good days (between 13 and 16), he usually deals 3.
> - When he strikes hard and well (between 17 and 19), he deals 4.
> - And if on top of that he hits the weak spot (20), he can do up to 5 points of damage in a single blow.

> ðŸ’¡ The same weapon can be more or less dangerous depending on who wields it.
> A master wielder might have a higher maximum on his damage range.

## Armor

A think layer of leather absorbs a portion of the kinetic energy of an incoming blade or arrow.
Another way to look at it: you have to push harder if you want to get through it or aim better find a weak spot.

Armor reduces incoming damage or makes you harder to hit.
You can chose either.
It does not need to be more complicated.

> ðŸ’¡ With the damage range rule described above, making you harder to hit is equivalent to reducing the damage received.
> This way, the armor mechanic is compatible whether you are using the damage range rule or not.
> Is it not beautiful?

Suggestion for a medieval setting:

| Armor         | Target difficulty increase / Damage reduction |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Light leather | 1                                             |
| Light metal   | 2                                             |
| Heavy metal   | 3                                             |
