# Advanced combat

For those who like it complicated. These tools are meant to enrich or ease combat design.

## Levels

All characters and creatures can be given a *level*.
This level is a number that gives a general idea of the threat that character or creature represents.
It helps answering the question: "who would win in a fight?"

A fight will be balanced if the opposing forces are of equal cumulated levels.
Remember, though, that fights are rarely supposed to be even.

A few rules of thumbs:
- The level can represent the maximum number of hit needed to put that character down.
- The level can represent the maximum amount of damage this character can deal in one blow.
- When attacking a character of lower level, the target difficulty of the attack roll is lower; and vice-versa.

| Character or creature archetype   | Suggested level |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Harmless civilian (e.g. merchant) | 1               |
| Tough civilian (e.g. lumberjack)  | 2               |
| Fighter (e.g. soldier)            | 3               |
| Knight                            | 4               |
| Dragon                            | 10-20           |

## Weapons stats

### Mastered wielding

The same weapon can be more or less dangerous depending on who wields it.
Some weapons even require specific training to be used at all (labelled "hard" in the second column).

| Weapon       | Untrained wielder use                      | Master use                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Crossbow     | Easy, but needs to be recharged every turn | No bonus                           |
| Bow          | Hard                                       | Acrobatics and trick shots         |
| Dagger       | Easy but short range                       | Easily concealed, precise stabbing |
| Sword        | Hard                                       | Fencing techniques                 |
| Hand gun     | Easy but short range                       | Quick draw and rapid fire          |
| Sniper rifle | Hard                                       | Long range and high damage         |
| Light saber  | Deadly for the wielder                     | Blocks incoming fire               |

### Damage

On a successful attack roll, the damage can be derived from the "quality" of the attack roll.
The better the success, the higher the damage.

Each weapon could have a range of damage that can be mapped to the range of favorable roll results.

> _Example:_
> 
> Jiora is wielding a heavy axe that deals 3-5 damages.
> He is used to wielding it, so he usually rolls with an 8 or higher on his d20 for his attacks to hit.
> If he barely hits (between 8 and 11), he deals 3 damage.
> But when he strikes hard and well (between 16 and 19), he deals 5.
> And if he hits the weak spot (20), he can do up to 10 points of damage in a single blow.
