# Advanced combat

For those who like it complicated. These tools are meant to enrich or ease combat design for the GM.

> ðŸ’¡ Although this rules were designed for combat, they can be used in any field.
> A rap battle between two characters can be refereed by rap levels, humiliation damage and self-esteem armor.

## Levels

All characters and creatures can be given a *level*.
This level is a number that gives a general idea of the threat that character or creature represents.
It helps answering the question: "who would win in a fight?"

A fight will be balanced if the opposing forces are of equal cumulated levels.
Remember, though, that fights are rarely supposed to be even.

A few rules of thumbs:
- The level can represent the maximum number of hits needed to put that character down.
- The level can represent the maximum amount of damage this character can deal in one blow.
- Dealing damage is harder for low-level characters and easier for high-level characters

| Character or creature archetype   | Level | Target difficulty of its attack rolls (d6) |
| --------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Harmless civilian (e.g. merchant) | 1     | 5                                          |
| Tough civilian (e.g. lumberjack)  | 2     | 4                                          |
| Fighter (e.g. soldier)            | 3     | 3                                          |
| Elite (e.g. knight)               | 4     | 2                                          |
| Boss (e.g. Dragon)                | 10-20* | 1

> (*) Bosses are meant to last longer, so they should be able to take a lot more hits; but they do not have to deal proportionally high damage.

PCs are not necessarily fighters, since neither the game nor the story have to revolve around combat.

Thus, depending on how good they are in a fight, PCs can start at any level.
If they get better, they can gain levels; if they get worse (age, injuries, out of practice), they can lose them.

## Damage

On a successful attack roll, the damage can be derived from the "quality" of the attack roll.
The better the success, the higher the damage.

By default, attacks deal 1 damage.

On a d6, if you need to roll at least X to hit and that you rolled X+Y, you deal Y extra damage.

*Example: Charlie's character, Croft, is a good fighter. His attacks hit on a 3 or higher (using a d6). Charlie rolls a 4, so Croft deals 2 damage (4 = 3+1 so 1 extra damage).*

## Armor

A think layer of leather absorbs a portion of the kinetic energy of an incoming blade or arrow.
Another way to look at it: you have to push harder if you want to get through it or aim better find a weak spot.

Armor reduces incoming damage or makes you harder to hit.
You can chose either.
It does not need to be more complicated.

> ðŸ’¡ With the damage rule described above, making you harder to hit is equivalent to reducing the damage received.
> Is it not beautiful?

The heavier the armor, the greater the protection, but the harder it is to move around.
