# Introduction

Welcome to Fiery Tales, a set of rules and guidelines for role playing games designed to fit any audience, no matter how nerdy it is.

## Wait, what is a "role playing game"?

In Fiery Tales, the term "role playing game" (RPG) refers to a gathering of at least 2 people inventing a story together.
One of them is typically called the "game master" (GM). Their role consists in narrating the story. The GM may occasionally play the role of "non-player characters" (NPCs).
The others are the "players" and play the role of the "player characters" (PCs), the protagonists.

For a more comprehensive definition of RPGs, there is an abundance of resources online; you could start with [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game).

## What do you mean, "any audience" and "highly flexible"?

RPGs have a long history of being "for nerds", but they grew in popularity and appeal to a wider audience now.
Games are usually very long, involve a lot of computations and rules can fill multiple heavy books.
With the recent bloom of RPGs, simpler alternative systems emerged, often advertised as kids-friendly.

This game system aims to offer a ruleset that is shockingly simple - and faster to play - at its core, and can get arbitrarily complicated for those who get into it. The different levels of complexity are fully compatible between each other, so that a GM can switch seamlessly between one and an other.

The following chapters describe the rules and guidelines ordered by increasing complexity.
