# Advanced character creation

Tools that help to add depth to your character.

## Defining traits

It makes it easier for everyone to visualize the adventure with a description of your character's appearance, personality and general flavor.

3 adjectives make a good basis.
Graphical illustrations help too!
They should not be judgemental but descriptive.
Qualities and flaws are described in the next paragraphs.

*Examples: the serious giant with a golden heart, the tiny musketeer mouse*

## Qualities and talents

This is what you are good at, what others count on you for.

You should start with one main quality or talent.
When trying to perform actions related to this quality, you will be in your comfort zone, meaning the target difficulty will be low.

*Examples: strong, fighter, acrobat, tactician, healer, psychologist, seductive*

## Flaws, weaknesses or disabilities

Nobody is perfect.

You should start with one main flaw, weakness or disability.
This is both a way to make you more relatable and an opportunity for character development.
It can also be useful for the GM in order to challenge your character specifically.

*Examples: greedy, hot-blooded, ugly, one-armed, clumsy, shy, blind*
